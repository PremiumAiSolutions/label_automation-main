# 🎉 Final Setup Complete - Label Automation System

## ✅ Current Status

Your label automation system is **READY TO USE**! Here's what's been set up:

### ✅ Completed:
- ✅ **All dependencies installed** (`install.py` completed successfully)
- ✅ **Real API keys configured** in `.env` file
- ✅ **EasyPost integration** working (test key - see notes below)
- ✅ **PrintNode integration** working  
- ✅ **Graceful printer handling** - works without printer ID until your printer arrives
- ✅ **Webhook endpoint** ready at `/webhook/easypost`
- ✅ **Health check** endpoint at `/health`
- ✅ **Label download & processing** fully functional
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging** and error handling

### ⚠️ Pending (when you're ready):
- ⚠️ **Printer ID** - Update when your new printer arrives
- ⚠️ **Production EasyPost key** - Your current key appears to be a test key

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
python -m app.main
```
The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Test the System
```bash
python test_webhook.py
```

### 3. When Your Printer Arrives
1. Find your printer ID:
   ```bash
   python setup.py printnode
   ```
2. Update `.env` file:
   ```env
   PRINTNODE_PRINTER_ID=12345  # Replace with your actual printer ID
   ```
3. Restart the application

## 📡 EasyPost Webhook Setup

In your EasyPost dashboard:
1. Go to **Webhooks** section
2. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/easypost`
3. Select event: **`tracker.created`**
4. Save the webhook

## 🔄 How It Works Now

1. **Webhook Received** → EasyPost sends `tracker.created` event
2. **Label Downloaded** → System gets the shipping label automatically
3. **Status Display** → Shows label info in console
4. **Printer Ready** → When printer is configured, it will auto-print
5. **Logging** → All events saved to `webhook_logs/` folder

## 📊 Current Behavior

**Without Printer Configured:**
```
===== LABEL READY FOR PRINTING =====
Status: Label downloaded successfully but printing skipped (no printer configured)
Action Needed: No printer configured yet. Update PRINTNODE_PRINTER_ID in .env when printer arrives.
===================================
```

**With Printer Configured:**
```
===== PRINT JOB SUBMITTED =====
Job ID: 12345
Printer ID: 67890
Title: Shipping Label - TRACK123
==============================
```

## 🔧 API Key Notes

### EasyPost Key:
- **Current:** `EZTK...` (Test Key)
- **For Production:** You'll need a production key starting with `EZAK...`
- **Test mode** works for testing but may have limitations

### PrintNode Key:
- **Status:** ✅ Production key configured
- **Ready:** Will work immediately when printer is added

## 📁 Project Files

Your complete system includes:

## 🎯 Next Steps
